# Changelog

## 0.17.0

### Host TUI control
- **Native-speed F3 attach.** F3 in the host client now suspends the client and runs a real
  `tmux attach` to the claude window, instead of proxying each keystroke over the network.
  Full native latency, colors, mouse and pickers; `Ctrl-b d` returns to the client.
- **One-key approval bar.** Pending knocks, commands, exports and file offers now surface as
  an approval bar above the status row (`[a]ccept [d]eny [i]gnore`, with a countdown), so a
  single keypress answers them without leaving the client — the popup feel from before the
  host session went fully detached.
- **Adaptive mirror frames.** The live TUI mirror now polls at 40ms while a client is watching
  and the pane is active, backing off to 250ms when idle, instead of a fixed 250ms poll —
  noticeably snappier during a busy turn, and zero polling cost once nobody is watching.

### Transport reliability
- `cloudflared`/Tailscale Funnel tunnels now auto-restart on failure with exponential backoff,
  so a dropped tunnel recovers on its own instead of leaving the session unreachable.
- The host/guest connection now uses WebSocket ping/pong heartbeats to detect and clean up
  dead sockets before they go stale.
- After repeated failed reconnect attempts, the client tells you the tunnel URL may have
  changed and to ask the host for a new one.
- New `--funnel` flag: host over **Tailscale Funnel** instead of `cloudflared` for a stable
  public hostname across restarts, real TLS, and nothing for guests to install.

### History and orientation for guests
- Joining a session now backfills recent history from the transcript on daemon boot, instead
  of guests landing in a blank room on a resumed or long-running session.
- A `── history above · live from here ──` divider marks where replayed history ends and the
  live session begins.

### Guests see the actual work
- Edit/Write/MultiEdit tool calls now render the real diff (file path plus `-`/`+` lines),
  instead of a truncated summary.
- New `/files` command: lists every path this session has touched, newest first, with a
  per-path change count.
- New `/diff [path]` command: `git diff --stat` by default, or a full diff for one path.
- Best-effort secret masking (AWS keys, private key blocks, API tokens, `.env`-style
  `KEY=value`) is now applied to tool output and the mirror view before it reaches guests.

### Guest parity and polish
- Guests can request to answer a pending permission prompt; the host approves, and only a
  validated digit (never raw keystrokes) is sent to the real prompt.
- Read-only commands (`/cost`, `/status`, `/context`) now run for guests without a host
  round-trip.
- A bell rings when the host has a permission prompt waiting, and when your name is mentioned
  in chat; a matching macOS desktop notification fires alongside it.
- The status bar now shows a live connection-quality indicator (round-trip time, or a
  staleness warning).
- Slash commands now autocomplete: typing `/` shows a filtered list of jam's own commands.
- Fixed a color in the per-user palette that was too close to the "you" color, making another
  participant's name easy to mistake for your own.

## 0.14.0

Baseline for this changelog.

- **Mirror-first client.** Every participant, host included, uses the same client view: the
  live TUI mirror is the default, with the transcript view as an F2 alternate.
- **Knock and token access.** Friends join with a shared token, or knock and wait for the
  host to accept or deny them from inside the client.
- **Built-in tunnel.** `--tunnel` stands up a `cloudflared` quick tunnel automatically, so the
  host doesn't need to open an inbound port or set one up by hand.
- **Session export.** A guest can request the session transcript; the host approves, and it's
  sent over the existing connection for a `claude --resume`.
- **Remote files.** Guests can send files (and pasted images) to the host, and the host can
  send files back — both gated by host approval.
